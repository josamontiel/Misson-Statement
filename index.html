            <p class="about-1">
            As an amateur web developer, I went through many of the beginner mistakes one makes when learning web development. They ranged from, starting too may projects without finishing to learning many programming languages at once.I started with basic web development languages (HTML, CSS and JS). HTML and CSS were ok, I still am not an expert as of now. I did manage to get a certificate from FreeCodeCamp but I still feel very much in the dark. Javascript is a while other animal for me. After getting my certificate, I stopped doing any kind of coding for about 3 months then decided i wanted to pick up Python. Python sounded a lot more interesting to me at the time and I was picking it up pretty fast. A lot faster than Javascript, so I thought Python was gonna be my bread and butter. A fried, the friend that actually got me into coding, suggested to look into data analytics, so I did. That led me to learn SQL as well. I ended up getting certificaes for both Python and SQL from a company called Mimo. Truthfully, I don't feel that confident about my Python and SQL knowledge though, I did manage to build some Python projects on my github, so I'm not a complete waste.</p>

            <p class="about-2">After a few months of Python and SQL, I realized it was kind of a waste for me because working with data and numbers analytics is boring. I had a lot more fun with web development. I could build far more useful stuff learning HTML/CSS/JS, things I'd actually want to use. I'm sure there are things one could build with Python as well, but for what I want to build, I'll be doing it with HTML/CSS/JS. What is driving me to stick with these languages is the Open Source community, all of the possibilities for everyday apps we all use, apps that are based on proprietary software. Since getting into coding i have been a huge proponent of keeping everything I do and build both free and open source. I do not plan on going back on that promise.</p>

            <p class="about-3">What the future looks like for my coding journey, I can not really answer that. What I plan to do? What I plan to do is build some firefox extensions that both I and the F/OSS community uses. I owe a lot to the Open Source community, everything I have learned about software I learned for <strong>FREE</strong> so naturally I would want to provide value to them in the same respect. I can still earn my money from the things I build, but I will do my best to ensure that 100% of the things I build are completely Free and Open Source.</p>
