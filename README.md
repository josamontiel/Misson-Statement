# Misson Statement
A quick mission statement I put together.

## But Why?

First off... Because I can. 

Secondly, as I build up my coding knowledge I am doing so out in the open. So part of that is providing as many repo's as possible to showcase what I am learning as well as giving insight into what the next steps are.

Enjoy!
